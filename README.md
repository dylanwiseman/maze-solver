# 4D Interdimensional Maze Solver

I absolutely bombed a tech interview once. 

The problem they gave me was to write an algorithm that could solve a simple 2D maze. I had literally no idea what to do, so I basically sat there, embarrassed and struggling for an hour til they cut me off. Vowing to never let that happen again, I taught myself how to solve their maze problem, then did 3D mazes, then got carried away and wrote an algorithm that solves 4D mazes by crossing the dimensional barrier that separates mazes in the Maze-verse. Let me know if you have any ideas for how I can make it traverse time as well.

In short, here's my 4D Maze Solving Algorithm I made cuz I was angry.

UPDATE: I learned Java, so decided to include a java version of the maze solver
